Welcome to the Web Portal Lite docs.

## What Is Web Portal Lite?
Web Portal Lite is a web dashboard to manage a page of links. It offers a minimal feature set to the feature rich [Web Portal](https://github.com/enchant97/web-portal). Designed for users who just want to create a fancy looking links page and not worry about the advanced features.

## Features
- Access a grid of beautiful links to your web services
- Works without JavaScript, to provide a lightning fast experience
- Customise dashboard through a basic yaml file (no database needed)
- Wide range of link colors
- Provide your own app icons for links
- Create groups of links
- Optionally secure the portal with user accounts
- Icon based theme
- Dark/Light mode
- Lightweight Docker image (uses scratch)

> If this feature set is too limited check out [Web Portal](https://github.com/enchant97/web-portal).
