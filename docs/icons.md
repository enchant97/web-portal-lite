# Icons
The available icons depends on what icons you have installed. They will match the filename without extension, taken from both the svg and png folder.

A popular repository for getting these icons is at: <https://github.com/walkxcode/Dashboard-Icons>. You can also get my app icons at: <https://github.com/enchant97/app-icons>. These projects are both in the correct format.

## Adding Icons
To set the icon name config you will need icons in the icon folder, these will need to be arranged in the format shown below:

```
icons/
    svg/
        some-app.svg
    png/
        some-app.png
```
